Addition:

If your interface another language, "not English" and text inside buttons don't fit in, you have to insert little changes in ubuntu.css

1)
1717# /*login size prompt input*/
1722# width: 190px; /* change width 190px to size what more or less will be close to 
                       size of your text inside buttons. Just try change width! */

2)
1591# /* Avatar Auth Dialogs & Screen Shield */
1594# margin: 0 0 0 60px; /* change margin 60px to centered your avatar */
